In order to avoid compatibility issues between fastlane versions, 
a Gemfile can be added to the root folder of the project (same deep as podfile).
This Gemfile should contain the fastlane version and its dependencies.
This will help the team to maintain the project in a conflict-free status 
Any new member on boarding can just refer to the github repository to get the correct fastlane version.

For details, go the "Use a Gemfile" section:

https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/setup/

Now, before this to work you need to install the bundler:
https://bundler.io

This works as an environment manager (Like the virtualenv for python)
So you can have a list of different environments for your ruby projects.
In this case we are using one environment for our specific fastlane version.
To install just  just run:
$ gem install bundler

Also you may needed to export the  your .zshrc (or your prefered console)
export PATH=$PATH:"/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/bin"

To know what is the path you can run:
.zshrc

$ gem environment
output:
 - RUBYGEMS VERSION: 2.7.7
  - RUBY VERSION: ...
  - INSTALLATION DIRECTORY: ...
  - USER INSTALLATION DIRECTORY: ...
  - RUBY EXECUTABLE: ...
  - EXECUTABLE DIRECTORY: /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/bin    <<------EXPORT THIS ONE
  - SPEC CACHE DIRECTORY: ...
  - SYSTEM CONFIGURATION DIRECTORY:...


  Everytime you need to run fastlane, you will also need to run the bundler commands:
  bundle exec fastlane [lane]
